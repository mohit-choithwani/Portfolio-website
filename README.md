## Master Thesis
**Title:** Analyzing the Input Sensitivity in Neural and Gaussian Splatting Methods for 3D Modelling of Human Head

Explores the optimization of input parameters vital for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of the head, resulting in the Chamfer distance of ~5 mm between the reconstructed head and the ground truth.
Conducted experiments with 20+ SOTA 3D surface reconstruction methods based on Neural Radiance fields and Gaussian Splatting under challenging conditions such as sparse settings (3, 5, and 7 images).
Quantified the robustness of these advanced techniques with different inaccuracies (Gaussian noise and low-intensity light) to determine which methods excel in real-world conditions.
Demonstrated that various forms of input corruption have varying impacts on the completeness of reconstructed 3D models.

## Projects

###  Title: Get Fit with PCA [Report](https://github.com/mohit-choithwani/Get_Fit_with_PCA/blob/main/Fitness%20App.pdf)
- Developed a computer vision-based fitness monitoring application that analyzes exercise videos to evaluate and score the accuracy of performed exercises.
- Implemented landmark extraction using the MediaPipe library to precisely detect body positions from video, followed by normalization of these landmarks through rigid alignment.
- Constructed a PCA model using Singular Value Decomposition on the normalized landmarks to capture essential movement parameters, assessing exercise accuracy by comparing the L2 norm against a set threshold for real-time evaluation.
