## Master Thesis
**Title:** Analyzing the Input Sensitivity in Neural and Gaussian Splatting Methods for 3D Modelling of Human Head

- Explores the optimization of input parameters vital for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of the head, resulting in the Chamfer distance of ~5 mm between the reconstructed head and the ground truth. 
- Conducted experiments with 20+ SOTA 3D surface reconstruction methods based on Neural Radiance fields and Gaussian Splatting under challenging conditions such as sparse settings (3, 5, and 7 images). 
- Quantified the robustness of these advanced techniques with different inaccuracies (Gaussian noise and low-intensity light) to determine which methods excel in real-world conditions. 
- Demonstrated that various forms of input corruption have varying impacts on the completeness of reconstructed 3D models.
